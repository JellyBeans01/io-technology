title: On-the-Fly Machine Learning in the Browser with TensorFlow.js
summary: TensorFlow.js makes machine learning incredibly accessible by bringing it to the browser. Front-end developers can use this to create amazing applications. In this talk, we’ll take a look at TensorFlow.js in combination with MobileNet, a lightweight deep neural network computer vision model perfect for the “low-powered” devices browsers often run on, bringing machine learning capabilities to everybody. We’ll not just have a look at how you can make this work, but will even train the dataset on the fly using transfer learning.
