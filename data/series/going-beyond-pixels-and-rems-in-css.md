summary: 'There are a lot of CSS units available at the moment and we mostly still rely on pixels and (r)ems for our sizing and fonts. I say it’s time to do a little freshening up. Instead of writing a list of which units are available in CSS that you can easily find on MDN as well, I thought I’d give some examples on where they could come in handy.'
