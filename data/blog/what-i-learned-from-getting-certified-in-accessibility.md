## Introduction

My last exam was at Howest (Kortrijk, Belgium) in 2015, so the experience of taking an exam was a long time ago.
In July 2021, I discovered the digital accessibility courses of Deque University, which has been my mainstay in terms of
accessibility training to this day.
Of course, during the 3 years that I have put my personal focus on accessibility, I have come across a lot of
interesting insights from the most experienced people in this field.

My personal favorites are [Karl Groves](https://twitter.com/karlgroves), [Sara Soueidan](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan), [Hidde de Vries](https://twitter.com/hdv) and [Jan Jaap de Groot](https://twitter.com/JanJaapdeGroot).

## What does "disability" mean to you?

Disability can have a very broad or narrow definition, depending on the context.
Most of the people rely on the legal definition of disability (economic model), which means being eligible for government benefits.
That's why people with disabilities are negatively viewed as being "needy" members of society (charity model).

So, ask yourself, what does "disability" mean to you? Do you think of disabilities in terms of non-functional body
parts? Do you think of disabling conditions in the built environment, or in our culture, or in political systems? Are
disabilities normal? Should we pity people with disabilities? Are people with disabilities "inspirational" when they learn to work around their disabilities?

### The assumptions

**_FIXME: Check list of models article_**

The assumptions we make have a profound impact on the lives of people with disabilities. That's why there is [a list of
theoretical models of disability](https://medium.com/offmessageorg/the-context-you-never-had-for-your-web-apps-the-7-theoretical-models-of-disability-b2cf0e0e4ed8), to categorize our assumptions and to examine the alternative pathways.

### The definition

In fact, there is no exact definition, but [the CDC definition of disability](<https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/disability.html#:~:text=A%20disability%20is%20any%20condition,around%20them%20(participation%20restrictions)>) can be considered a good reference: "A disability is any condition of the body or mind (impairment) that makes it more difficult for the person with the condition to do certain activities (activity limitation) and interact with the world around them (participation restrictions)."

So to summarize, anything that limits activity and/or interaction is a disability.

**_FIXME: To check_**

Include part of glasses, injury, etc to be more illustrate how broad the concept "disability" is???

## Why statistics are not that relevant and hard to find (biases, public relations, collection methods, etc)

### Definitions vary widely

The first thing to consider is what I've illustrated in the first section "What is a disability", definitions vary so much that statistics aren't based on the same definition.

### Difference in how data is collected

Some surveys rely on individuals to report their own disabilities, others rely on external observations.
Some surveys are meant to collect data concerning "eligibility for governments benefits", which will obviously result in more people responding positively.
Also, the wording of the questions in the survey can result in different statistics.
Even phrasing a question like "Do you have a disability?" compared to "Do you experience difficulty seeing text well
enough to read it?" has its impact on the meaningfulness of the collected data.

## Interpretation is the deciding factor, lead by empathy (get to know the people behind and how they approach their environment)

...

## The history of theoretical models and how they evolved (charity to social)
