## Introduction

My last exam was at Howest (Kortrijk, Belgium) in 2015, so the experience of taking an exam was a long time ago.
In July 2021, I discovered the digital accessibility courses of Deque University, which has been my mainstay in terms of
accessibility training to this day.
Of course, during the 3 years that I have put my personal focus on accessibility, I have come across a lot of
interesting insights from the most experienced people in this field.

My personal favorites are [Karl Groves](https://twitter.com/karlgroves), [Sara Soueidan](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan), [Hidde de Vries](https://twitter.com/hdv) and [Jan Jaap de Groot](https://twitter.com/JanJaapdeGroot).

## The perception of the term 'disability'

### What it means to most of us?

Most of the (able-bodied) people rely on the legal definition of disability, which means being eligible for government benefits (cfr.
economic model).
That's why people with disabilities are negatively viewed as being "needy" members of society (cfr. charity model).

| Model          | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Economic model | The economic model views disabilities from the perspective of the economic impact of the disability on individuals, employers, the state, and welfare programs.                                                |
| Charity model  | The charity model treats disabilities as unfortunate or tragic conditions worthy of special treatment. People without disabilities take pity on those with disabilities and set up fundraisers, projects, etc. |

### What it means to me?

The way I looked at disabilities before diving into accessibility a few years ago, was very closely aligned with the
economic and charity models. I thought of it as people that needed help from able-bodied people, financially and mentally.

But now, after 3 years of genuine interest in accessibility, my point of view has changed a lot.

For me, the term "disability" is now very broad, not just refering to a subset of society. If you would ask me for a
definition, I would say:

> Anything that limits activity and/or interaction is a disability.

For example: people wearing glasses is not referred to as people with a disability, but theoretically those people have a visual
impairment. Society doesn't look at it that way, since it's a common phenomenon that is part of the aging process.

### What does it mean to you?

So, ask yourself, what does "disability" mean to you? Do you think of disabilities in terms of non-functional body
parts? Do you think of disabling conditions in the built environment, or in our culture, or in political systems? Are
disabilities normal? Should we pity people with disabilities? Are people with disabilities "inspirational" when they
learn to work around their disabilities?

The assumptions we make have a profound impact on the lives of people with disabilities. That's why there is a list of [theoretical models of
disability](https://medium.com/offmessageorg/the-context-you-never-had-for-your-web-apps-the-7-theoretical-models-of-disability-b2cf0e0e4ed8),
to categorize our assumptions and to examine the alternative pathways. In the previous section I mentioned the economic
and charity model, which are part of that list.

## Why disability statistics are so variable

### Definitions vary widely

The first thing to consider is how we define the term 'disability', definitions can vary so much. If you define
disabilities as a narrow fact, then the statistics will represent a smaller percentage of people with a disability. The
same applies in the other direction, a broad definition will result in a larger percentage.

Traditionally, disability statistics has been conceived as a matter of counting people
who fall into specific groups such as 'the blind', 'the deaf', 'wheelchair users', etc in order to
determine who qualifies for benefits. With very limited purpose in mind, this
categorical approach gives a fragmented and distorted picture of disability since it
suggests that person with disability fall neatly into a few categories with clear
boundaries.

### Difference in how data is collected

Some surveys rely on individuals to report their own disabilities, others rely on external observations.
Some surveys are meant to collect data concerning "eligibility for governments benefits", which will obviously result in more people responding positively.
Also, the wording of the questions in the survey can result in different statistics.
Even phrasing a question like "Do you have a disability?" compared to "Do you experience difficulty seeing text well
enough to read it?" has its impact on the meaningfulness of the collected data.

### Publication bias

Some countries, institutes or organisations are not eager to share information that could possibly have a negative
impact on their public relations. Therefore, it can be impossible to get accurate data.

## Disability etiquette

### Deaf and deaf

I learned that there is a difference between Deaf and deaf, where Deaf with a capital letter is referring to the Deaf
community and deaf with lowercase simply refers to the physical condition of having hearing loss.

The Deaf community is a very strong and close community with its own culture and sense of identity, based on a shared
language.

Also, the common misconception that all deaf people use sign language is a myth. Many deaf people, especially those who were deaf at any
early age, use sign language, but not all of them.

### Service animals

Service animals (such as guide dogs) are doing a job. When they're in work mode, do not pet them, play with them, feed
them, or draw their attention in any way. These animals are in service of their owner. Distracting service animals from
their job makes it harder for the owner to control the animal's actions.

So, be sure to ask the owner first. Do not interact with the animal without the owner's knowledge and permission.

## Conclusion

What I want you to remember from this article is 2 things:

- Think of people with disabilities first and foremost as people, just like everyone else. Challenge yourself, get to
  know your target audience and let's develop products that provide equal access regardless of a person's circumstances.
  Eventually, this will benefit all of us (more information: [universal design](https://uxplanet.org/universal-design-design-for-everyone-61ded4243658)).
